## Overview of Project 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### Technologies Involved
There are multiple technologies that come together in this project:
* HTML
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Bootstrap - a styling enhancement library to CSS that features Mobile and Responsive capabilities.  Also a grid system for dividing the HTML document and enhancing many of the HTML tags.
* JavaScript
* D3.js - a JavaScript library to enhance JavaScript for data-driven documents

### Technical Overview
This project was to create a new HTML document, *Index.html*,  that would house a dynamic table of data that consumers could use to research the subject of UFO sightings.  The data covers a time span of about 2 weeks in January of 2010, but there is sighting data from cities all across the United states.  The data is pulled from a JavaScript file that contains a list of dictionaries of data or JSON objects, approximately 134 objects.

The HTML document is structured with sections or divided into grids with CSS and Bootstrap styling.  Following image of the site at initial launch.
